Input dependence rate:
Percentage of correctly classified inputs with object overlay by model trained on scene labels,
where region of object overlay is attributed less than that same region when the overlay
is removed. 1 - IDR can be interpreted as "false positive rate": rate of explanations
that assign higher importance to less important features.
